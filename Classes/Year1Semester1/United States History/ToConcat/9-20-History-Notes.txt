Pilgrims in Leyden Holland. They wanted their children to grow up English, not Dutch. They're able to get two ships, Speedwell and the Mayflower. They left Holland in August of 1620. As soon as they're out of sight of land, the Speedwell starts sinking, and they return back to Holland. They decide to try to make it on the Mayflower. Those who were on the Speedwell didn't want to try to cross the ocean again. They decide to stop in England to pick up more passengers. They pick up 67 more passengers. Not all of them are separatists. In December they leave again, without everyone on-board. On November 9th, the finally reach New England, and they land in what is now Province Town. Captain Mile Standish led a party to explore the inner cape. In December he finds a good harbor and he names it Plymouth. Since not all of them were separatists, they created the Mayflower compact. They landed on the beach, not on Plymouth rock. They began to build housing. They eventually found a Patuxet village. In the first spring, more the half the pilgrims had died. Among the first dead was John Carver. The original destination of the pilgrims was Virginia. They feared shipwreck, so they stayed in Plymouth. However, Plymouth was outside the legal boundaries for the Virginia charter, so they couldn't legally claim any land, but they did. The pilgrims had trouble governing themselves, and they still needed to claim the land, somehow. Luckily they had friendly merchants back in England, who worked out a deal to claim the land for them. They worked out a charter for the land. The merchants had a title for the land, but it had to be payed back. William Bradford was selected to succeed Governor Carve. In spring, an English speaking native came to the village. His name was Squanto, he claimed he was the last surviving Patuxet. He helped the pilgrims. He taught them how to plant maize. He introduced the colonists to Massasoit. His name was Ousamequin, Massasoit was his title. Massasoit meant Great Sachem(chief). They helped harvest the food in the fall of 1621. They held a 3 day feast. The future was looking good for the surviving 51 colonists. Then a ship pulled in, called the Fortune. The Fortune has 35 more colonists. 35 more colonists than the pilgrims originally planned on feeding. There won't be enough food for everyone until the next harvest. The Fortune takes fur and logs, and as soon as its out of sight of land, the French capture it. They make a deal to pay the merchants in 1642, but they don't. However, they do pay them off in 1657. The investors created a joint stock company that they called the . Out of the 120 investors, 20 of them were Puritans. Puritans were members of the Anglican church, they were radical protestants who wanted to purify the Anglican church. One problem the Puritans had with the church of England was the use of bishops. The Puritans went strictly by the bible; There was no mention of bishops in the bible, and as a matter of fact, the bible never establishes the rule of bishops or kings.
