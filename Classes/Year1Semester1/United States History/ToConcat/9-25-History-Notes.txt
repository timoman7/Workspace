Anne Hutchinson
She divided the community. People began to take sides. In 1636, Governor Winthrop decided to put her on trial. The charges were that she was: Subverting the teachings of the ministers. Dividing the community (She said she was going to divide it more). She was acting unwomanly.
They kick her and followers out of Boston. They originally head to Rhode Island. Eventually, her and her family head to Connecticut. The ministers were so angry at her, any time something went wrong with her, they brought it up. In 1643, the Indians killed Anne and 5 of her children. The ministers in Boston preached how she had strayed from the path of God, and this was God paying her back.
