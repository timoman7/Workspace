Discuss the background of the pilgrims and the puritans 

Before the pilgrims came to Plymouth, there were numerous attempts to colonize the new England area. Back in 1602 Bartholomew Gosnold and 32 men sailed on the ship, the concord, from England to present day Maine. They expected to establish a colony there. Instead, they decided to travel further south, along the coast. They went down to present day Martha's Vineyard. Where they stayed for about 5 weeks, trading furs with the Native Americans. They eventually aggravated the natives. And after 1 of the English party gets injured, they decide to return to England. In 1607 the Plymouth company sent an expedition to the Kennebec river in present day Maine. And this colony only lasted about a year. This cost the Plymouth company a lot of money. So the Plymouth company decided to skip the colonization portion of the program. They're gonna go to New England and just trade for furs, and fish. This inevitably led to confrontations with the French. The French were at Port Royal, the Saint Laurence river. The French had their Indian allies among certain tribes. That left other tribes to become allies with the English. The English set up a commercial network among these tribes. And these tribes were enemies to each other, too. They were competing for these European goods. Before the founding of Plymouth, the Indians had fairly extensive experience with the English. This brought catastrophic results for the natives from the English. From 1616 to 1618, a plague was brought over by the English. Large areas of the coast were completely depopulated. Left them open to the English settlements in the 1620s and the 1630s. At first the English were friendly, but they eventually started treating them as lesser beings. They would shoot the Native Americans if they walked into their village on the sabbath. They would kidnap their children, for diplomatic reasons later on. They'd make trade agreement and break them. In 1613, John Smith mapped out the coast of New England. It was the dissenters of the English Church that came from England. The Pilgrims were separatists. One group of these separatists was led by John Robinson. They were led by their meetings in the home of Brewster. They were found out, and realized that if they wanted to live, they had to leave. So they made their way to Leyden, Holland. There, the Dutch had accepted them.
