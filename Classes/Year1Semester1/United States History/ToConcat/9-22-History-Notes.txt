Over in America, the biggest of the churches was called the congregational. They believed all they needed was ministers, not bishops. A minister is just a holy learning man. Harvard college gwas found in 1636; The first graduating class became ministers. Each of these congregational churches goverened itself, supported itself from funds raised from the congregation. They had no altars, no statues, no stained glass representations of saints. The churches were just very plain houses of worship. They didn't celebrate christmas or any other holy days. The ministers didn't wear any of the vestments that the catholic priests did; They wore plain suits. At their meetings they didn't sing any hymns. The puritans follow the teachings of a frenchman named Jean/John Calvin. He taught what was called Predestination. Predestination is the belief that the destiny of each and every person has been predetermined by God. And most of us are going to hell. The elect, the pure ones, will be saved. And the so called visible saints, the true christians, the puritans in other words, are the elect. They were going to heaven and everyone else was going to hell. They were very very intense christians. Puritans not only challenged the authority of the church; They challenged the authority of the king. In 1625, Charles I becomes the king of England. He's the king of england from 1625 to technically 1649. He had a strong dislike for puritans, because they challenged his authority. And subsequently he cracks down on them. But the puritans continue to grow in strength. The king wanted the puritans to conform to his idea of religious practices, the vestments, the sings to hyms, the holy days; All the ideas not dropped off by the Roman catholics. Well the king gets mad; he fires hundreds of ministers, and hundreds of professors from cambridge university. They were all teaching Calvinism. Cambridge England was the heart and soul of the puritan movement. In the late 1620s, within a decade or so, you're gonna have the English war. By the late 1620s, the puritans are mad as hell. They believed that england is moving away from the teachings of the bible. (Mass Bay company 20 puritans). In 1628, the Mass Bay company asks the king for a royal charter in America. They get it in 1629, they called it the charter of 1629(inventive). It does a few things; first: it grants Mass Bay company all the land from 3 miles north of the Merrimac river to 3 miles south of the Charles River. It was from the atlantic to the pacific. Second: The company can govern the colony through meetings. About 4 times the year of the stockholders. They call this the general court. Massachusettes still has the general court. Lastly: That general court anually elects a governer, a luitenant governer, and 8 assistants(judges & magistrates). Very important to remember that the Mass Bay company is a business. Another important thing to remember is that the king messed up. The charter does not say where the charter itself has to be kept. IT also doesn't say where the company meetings must be held. This really opened the door for the puritans. First governer of the Mass Bay company was governer Cradock. He called the meeting of the company to be held in July of 1629, in Cambridge England, the heart and soul of puritanism. Who's gonna show up to this meetings: Just the puritans. A vast majority of the stockholders at the meeting are puritans. In October during the meeting, they elect a new governer, a puritan named John Winthrop. The puritans are the super majority at this meeting now, they have full control. They pass a company rule, an agreement, the cambridge agreement. It states that every owner of stock in the Mass Bay company must move to Massachusettes along with the charter itself. That's huge, they're taking the charter away from the king. And if you're not willing to move to Massachusettes, you have to sell your stock to someone who is. Only ones willing to move there are puritans. The intent of the puritan founders was to establish a self-governing puritan commonwealth. A theocratic state ruled by the godly, the puritans. In other words, a state ruled by the puritans, allowing only puritan ideas, puritan beliefs. In 1630, on the deck of his flightship, the Arbella, John Winthrop gave his now famous sermon: That massachusettes was to be a city on a hill, a beacon for all to see. Before that, they sent a party of workers to send a smooth beginning for the colonies. The king knew nothing about it. The first group head for the colony of salem, or established it, rather. They were lead by Lt. Gov. John Endicot. They established salem, but when Winthrop arrived with over 1000 colonists, he decides to head further south. He pulls into the bay at the foot of Sharmer Hill, where he gives the speech. If you look into the history of Boston, you'll see Saint Botolph. He named his colony after Saint Botolph, Patron saint of Boston. Puritans are completely against the idea of saints. During the war, the puritans are destroying all imagery of saints. Winthrop probably didn't name it after a saint. In 1631, Mass Bay company general court passed a rule called the Rule of 1631. The rule of 1631 states: Only adult male, heads of households, who are members of Massachusettes Congressional churches, may vote or hold office. That meant you had to attend church, pay taxes(tithes) for the minister, you had to be elected to become a member of that church; You're elected by the members of that church.
This meant that the puritans will always rule the colony. There were dissenters of the puritans policies. One was Reverend Roger Williams. First bad thing was he wasn't a puritan at all, he was a separatist. He went to salem for a while and came back to boston. They hated his radical ideas. He was a very outspoken guy, he didn't hold back. He actually pushed for justice for the Indians. He wanted people to buy land from them instead of just taking. He came up with the idea of seperating church from state. He believed no one should be punished for their religious beliefs. This was circa 1636. One of the crazier puritans of the time was Reverend John Cotton. He started attacking Roger Williams. He said his ideas would spell the end of the puritan colony. They bring Williams up on charges; They spell him and his followers from the colony. They leave, and they head southwest, and they found the colony of Rhode Island. (Find out the real name of Rhode Island, hasn't changed since). In Rhode Island they practiced what he preached, his tolerance. As a matter of fact, the very first Jewish Sinigoge in the United States is still there. The other dissenter was the mistress Anne Hutchinson. She was a wealthy and prominent merchant, in a time where women did not have wealthy lives and careers. The puritans didn't like her. She started talking against the ministers of Boston, that they were preaching wrong. The biggest problem they had with Anne Hutchinson was that she was brilliant, that she could talk rings around them. They put her on trial.
