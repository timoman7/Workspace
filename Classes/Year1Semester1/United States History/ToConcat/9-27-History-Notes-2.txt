Describe the early relations between the English colonists and the Native Americans, 1584-1676. Discuss, in detail, the three major wars and the sources of each conflict?
The contact between the Europeans and the Native Americans occurred long before the creation of the American colony.
They built this policy with the belief that Native Americans were subhumans. Not equal to the Spaniards. The Spanish saw the natives as savages. They saw that they needed either, Christianity, or death. The French in North and Central America were very different in their treating of the Native Americans. For the most part, the French formed alliances whenever possible with the different federations they encountered. By treating the Indians as equal partners, it usually resulted in mutual benefits, usually huge profits for the French. It also gave the french many strong allies during confrontations with the English. If you make an ally, you also make enemies; Your allies enemies become yours. This left some tribes to become allied with the English (Incas?).

Interaction between Native Americans and the English colonists.
The English tended to treat the Indians with the same disdain as the Spanish. John Smith was not an accommodating fellow when it came to Indians. He kidnapped and killed them when he wanted to. Before the Jamestown colony was the colony at Roanoke. One of the leaders of this first group was named Arthur Barlowe. He was either high, or he was a liar. Roanoke lacked good soil, didn't have a deep harbor. William Raleigh sends Richard Grenville and Ralph Lane to lead an expedition, they were military men, veterans of the Irish campaign. They led the next colony. They were gonna run the colony like a military camp. Grenville had a habit of when he got mad, he would break a glass cup and eat the glass. Ralph Lane tried to gain the cooperation of the Indians, or rather the Indian leader. Oddly, trying to do this; He kidnapped the leader's favorite son. Next year in April 1586, a shipment of supplies doesn't show up. Lane looks at the Indians like they're gonna attack. So he decides to launch a preemptive counterattack. He cuts off the head of Wingina and puts it on a post around the fort. Now it is in summer. Their food is almost gone. Any relations they had with the Indians is definitely gone. And no supply ships are scheduled to come. They can't plant, hunt, or fish, because the Indians are waiting outside their fort waiting for them to come out. They were very lucky, all of a sudden they see a sail. None other than Francis Drake, a future pirate, shows up. He's loaded with supplies. Grenville and Lane order the people to unload all the supplies. He doesn't want the supplies, he want's them off the boat so they can sail back to England. So Walter Raleigh tries again. He picks a man named John White to lead this expedition. There's over a hundred settlers this time. He tells John White to go further North. Apparently, John White and the pilot argue who is in charge. They show up at Roanoke, and the pilot dumps them there and leaves.
