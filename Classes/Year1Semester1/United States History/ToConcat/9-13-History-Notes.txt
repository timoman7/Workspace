United States History I notes
Lack of leadership. No king present, current king is in England.
King appoints counsel to his name; didn't work.
September 1608, mercenary John Smith is elected president of the counsel. Takes control of the colony.
Smith was never friendly towards Indians. His treatment of the Powhatans, and their leader, Chief Powhatan, was never understood.
Instead of asking or trading for provisions, Smith would simply take them with threats or simply kill the Indians for them. This was in spite of the Indians saving his life on several occasions. So in 1609, the first of many wars broke out between the Indians and the English. Both sides were brutal. English murdered the Indians, women and children, didn't matter. Even decapitated them, as it bothered the Indians.
For their part, the Powhatans would skin the English alive. Or they would simply scalp them. The Indians learned that from the French, as the act of it wasn't native to the Indians.
John Smith tried to pull the colony together. He was only 26 years old when he arrived at the colony. John Smith was a loud mouth, self-promoter; He bragged about his bravery and resourcefulness,  albeit it true. He forced survivors and newcomers to build, plant, hunt, and fish, to prepare for the next winter. He had a simple rule; If you do not work, you do not eat. He ran the colony as if it was the military, and the company loved it.
The colony had no proper product, for which there was a market. No crop, no product meant no trade, and no profit. No profit means angry investors.
There were very very very few women. This meant there were not a lot of children.
Investors were becoming very upset at the lack of profits. Investors continually asked to supply more money to supply the colonists.
Each of these problems had a solution.
	Site location solution: Move away from the swampy, marshy area. Cases of malaria dropped immediately. They believed the wind carried the illness. They moved to higher ground.
	Solution to the personnel: Solved Ca 1613. The colony needed young healthy men to make it succeed. England had a lot of people that needed land.
		Solution A: Headright system: The company will give 50 acres of land for any person who can pay their way over from England to Virginia. For each additional person that you can pay for to come over as well, you get another 50 acres of land.
		Solution B: Indentured Servitude: Someone between the ages of 13 to 17 who agreed to become the unpaid servant of a master, who in turn would pay for their voyage to Virginia. Once in Virginia, they would remain the property of that master, who in turn would house, feed, and cloth them, for a period of between 5 to 7 years. At the end of that 5 or 7 years, they would receive their freedom, and property between 5 to 10 acres of land. Captains of the voyage ships would find people to come to Virginia, pay for them, and have them sign contracts; Once there, they would sell the contracts to people who needed work. Servants were treated very harshly. Women contracts were destroyed if they agreed to marry their master.
	Solution to problem of leadership: Solved Ca 1609. James I gave the company a new charter. The company could now appoint a governor who would rule in Jamestown. First governor appointed was James Delaware. He never makes it to Virginia, and is shipwrecked in Bermuda. In 1610, Sir Thomas Dale arrives. Dale is an old army man. He enforced the Dale-Laws, meant to shock the colony into discipline.
	Solution to lack of crop: Given by John Rolfe. Companies investors feel like they're making empty investments, some are complaining to the king. Colonists in Virginia find Tobacco weed growing. In England, they've been smoking Tobacco for half a century. That Tobacco comes from Turkey. John Rolfe obtains West Indian Tobacco seed and plants it. West Indian Tobacco flourishes in Virginia. It makes John Rolfe and his neighbors very wealthy. Tobacco becomes known as “brown gold”. Rolfe helped win peace with Indians by marrying Pocahontas. In 1616, Pocahontas dies and is buried in London.
	Solution to problem of no women: Solved by Headright system and Indentured Servitude.
Two big things happen that would change the colonies, and the future of the United States, in 1619. Virginia company establishes the House of Burgesses. Original House of Burgesses was established as a council of advisers, consisting of white male land owners. It would later develop into a lawmaking council, the only one in the British empire. It was technically established in 1618, but didn't meet until 1619. Second occurrence, Dutch merchant ship pulled into Chest bay area. They were low on water. On board they had 20 black African slaves. The Dutch weren't slave traders at the time, most likely captured them from Portuguese slave traders. This opened a new way for plantation owners to look at their labor situation. The new slaves weren't going to get land at the end of their contract. At this period of time, they were never going to be free, so they would never complete their indenture. Slavery from the very beginning was a racist institution.
