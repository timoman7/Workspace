By 1619 Virginia is firmly established, and it's already developing its own style. But it was still not making money. And it's investors were more and more complaining to the crowd. In 1622 there was a major Indian uprising. The whites in the Chesapeake area numbered over 2000 people. At a certain point, the Indians simply stopped and started to attack. They wipe out more than 300 of the white colonists. The Indians didn't care who they killed. It was over as quick as it began. The whites wiped out the Indians who were involved. As a result, the whites starting killing every Indian they found in the area, along the Chesapeake river. Virginia company investors got the king so upset with their complaining, that he revoked the Virginia company's charter. In 1625, he made Virginia a royal colony, ruled by the king. That's the end of the Virginia company, and the beginning of the end for the Indians in the Chesapeake area.
