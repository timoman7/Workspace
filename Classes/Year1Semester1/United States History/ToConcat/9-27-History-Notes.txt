Quakers
They were pacifists. They refused to show respect to kings or queens. They believed that was a violation of gods law, to show respect of one person over another. They spoke in old English. They were hated and persecuted not only in England, but in the colonies as well. King Charles II hates young William Penn, because of his beliefs. The king owed Penn's father 16,000 English Pounds. Unfortunately for the king, Penn's father died before he could pay him back. Now he owed the 16,000 Pounds to young William Penn. William Penn would obtain the land that would become Pennsylvania, after his father; It meant Penn's Woods. The reason he wanted that area, was because it was a good location. The area that he would make his future capital, Philadelphia, had a good harbor; It was destined to become the largest city in the colony.  He also wanted it for personal reasons. He wanted it to get it. Secondly, he wanted to do good, to help mankind. Penn was what they call a philanthropist. He personally wanted to prove the idea that the Quakers weren't crazy. That the Quaker ideas were the essence of humanity, brotherly love. Lastly, he wanted to show that people in his colony of diverse background could exist and live together in harmony. Finally, on March 4th of 1601, Penn gets the charter for Pennsylvania, wipes out the kings debt. He names his capital Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. With all his good intentions, the problem was, William Penn was a horrible business man. He advertised for people to come to Pennsylvania, in the colonies and in England. He got a mixed response. Who were the people that came to Pennsylvania? New England Puritans, they hated the Quakers, but they loved the rich soil. The Dutch and the Swedes also came to Pennsylvania. It looked like a golden country to them, freedom from persecution. English Quakers also came. The Pennsylvania Deutsch also came, they eventually became known as the Amish. Another group that came was the Scots-Irish. They weren't Irish. When England conquered Ireland, they sent the Scots from Ireland. The Scots-Irish loved to fight. Overall, Penn's holy experiment really worked, all these different kinds of people lived together in peace. Except for one notable exception: William Penn allowed slavery. Which is odd, considering how all of Penn's writings showed how against slavery he was.
