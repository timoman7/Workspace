(Narra) =  Narragansetts
(Wess) =  Wessagusetts
(Poka) =  Pokanokets
Squanto helped negotiate an alliance between the settlers and the Pokanokets. Against their traditional enemies, the Narragansetts. The (Poka) thought by doing this they were protecting their homeland. The English rewarded Squanto by giving him some land. Before Squanto died in 1622, he tried to get the (Poka) to attack the English. In 1622, some (number) settlers, the Wessagusett, stole some corn from the Massachusetts tribe. The (Wess) threatened them with attack if they don't trade. Mile (Name at 9 minutes) led an assault at (also 9 minutes in) including their leader, Witumamet, and he put his head on a pike. In 1633-34, Smallpox ravaged the Indians. The pilgrims and the puritans looked at this as gods intervention, just when they needed more land. They were nasty in the ways they got land from the Indians. Some of them took questionable claims to the courts. Some would send their livestock to their property, and say something like “The livestock know where they want to live”. All of this led to what became known as the Pequot war. The settlers claimed it was because of the murder of 2 sea captains: One was captain John Stone; Captain Stone was already an outlaw by the time he was killed in 1634. The other was Captain John Oldham; He was found dead off the coast of (block? 14 min) island. They weren't really the reason for the war, the real reasons for the war were: 1st Hostility towards the native Americans. 2nd  Trade rivalry with the Dutch. And lastly, 3rd was inter-tribal disputes. The dutch controlled trade in new England in the 1630s, through the tribes in New England. The dutch bought land from the Pequots in present day. They built an outpost to supposedly ward off the English. Some Indian tribes were already signing over with the New Englanders. The Mohegans wanted to get out from under the thumb of the (Pequots? 17 min). They did so with the help of Aron Manson. The Mohegans asked the dutch for some help. The Pequots were a pretty nasty group, very aggressive people. The name Pequot means destroyer. (Notes at 19 min). The dutch in turn killed the Pequots and banned from the post. The Narragansetts mobilized for war. The Pequots turn to the Narragansetts colony for help. They invite the (20 min) for help, start trading with them. The Puritans establish the settlement, and a truce is arranged between them and the Pequots. The Pequots looked at this as a truce among equals, but not the Puritans. After a couple of years, the Puritans demand that the Pequots deliver the murderers of Captain John Stone. The Pequots refuse, but they kept the peace. A few days after this, the body of Captain Oldham washed up on (block? 23 min) Island. Once again, the Puritans blamed the Pequots, but in reality it was the Narragansetts. So the Puritans launched an attack of (block? 23 min) Island, and the main land(23-24 min notes). Both of these attacks were disasters. The Pequots pushed the Puritans into the old Fort Saybrook (25 min notes). At this point, Roger Williams arranged with the Narragansetts to sign a peace treaty with the English. The English Puritans in Connecticut gathered around 100(70?) men and broke the siege at Fort Saybrook. That was in April of 1637. Now with the help of some more (Narra), they attacked a Pequot village, right along the (26 min) river, there was a massacre. First it was mostly women and children. They surrounded the village and set it on fire, they wouldn't let anybody out. Colonists from Massachusetts and Connecticut, (27 min notes) began to hunt the Pequots down, sold everybody who wasn't slain into slavery. That pretty much ended the Pequot tribe. Trouble with the natives ended for nearly 3 decades, and ended the Pequot war. But their need to Christianize the Indians, (28 min notes), and the ever expanding need for land, led to the next war. This began the (28-29 min) war. The son of the Massasoit, Metacomet, was born after the Pequot war. He lived in Massachusetts. When Massasoit, died in 1660, his elder son, Wamsutta, became chief. They were given names by the Plymouth colony. Wamsutta was given the name Alexander. Metacomet was given the name Phillip. As leader of the Wampanoags, Alexander did his best to protect the land. Their all suing each other to get pieces of land away from each other. Finally in 1664, a commissioner sent over by the king, they decide that no colony (32 notes). On top of that, the commission designated Metacomet a free (something at 32), meaning he only has to answer to the king, not any colony. Now, Alexander had already been selling land before the commission. In 1664, an armed party of colonists from Plymouth take him captive. They're gonna force him to testify in court, and force him to sell them some land. Great plan except Alexander dies in jail. Phillip expects poison. He remains very wary of the English after he becomes chief. Philip continues selling to both colonies, as a conscious and aggressive act of independence. He's making it clear that he, not the colonies, legally own the land. The Plymouth colony establish a site across the village, called Swansea. One of king Phillips councilors, went to Plymouth and told them Phillip was getting ready to attack. (36-37 min notes). The English arrested 3 Wampanoags, but they weren't the ones who did it. (38 min notes). On June 20th, 1675, Phillips Indians cross the water into Swansea and attack the cattle, a 10 year old with a musket protects the cattle and shoots and kills one of the Indians, that's the start of the war. (39 min notes). They raid (towns at 40 min). By this time over 100 whites are killed. February 20th 1676, they attacked Lancaster again, capturing Mary Rowlenson. They ambush 65 Plymouth soldiers and their allies. (numbers at 41 min). A few days later, March 29th 1676, they burned the city of Providence Rhode Island to the ground. It got to the point, 10 miles of the attack, in the city of Boston, where the city leaders considered building a wall around the city to protect it, so they put it to a vote. It didn't pass because it was 1 vote shy. On July 22nd 1676, (name at 44 min) captured King Phillips child. King Phillip was enraged, and was so mad that he jumped up and killed the warrior next to him. The warriors brother, went and told Church were to find him. Church found Phillip and killed him. The last band of villagers was captured on August 28th of 1676 and sold into slavery.
