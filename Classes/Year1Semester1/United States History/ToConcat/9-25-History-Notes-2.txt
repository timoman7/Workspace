Discuss the background of the Pilgrims and the Puritans. What were the intentions of the Puritan Founders of the Mass Bay Colony? Discuss dissenters and why they were dealt with so harshly in both England and Massachusetts?

In 1607, we had the colony in Virginia. It was a company run colony. Next we have a privately run colony, in1620, Plymouth. Another company run colony, Mass Bay Colony, in 1630. Plymouth and Mass Bay are going to end up as royal colonies, under what is called the Dominion of New England. It's also gonna include Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, and New Jersey. (Proprietary colony notes, around 20 minutes in)
Another private mostly Puritan colony was Connecticut. In 1679, New Hampshire was formed as a royal colony.
He wanted Presbyterian Scotland to convert to his Anglican church, by force if necessary. The civil war finally breaks out in 1642, it's between the Cavaliers, the royalist forces, and the Roundheads, the parliamentary forces. Oliver Cromwell, leader of the Roundheads, led them to victory. He captured King Charles I, put him in the Tower of London. In 1649, he executed him. Between 1649 and 1660, England was a Puritan Commonwealth. Oliver Cromwell ruled alone, through the force of his army until his death in 1688(Maybe). His son took over after his death, but he wasn't strong enough to keep it together. They decide to put the monarchy back in power. They put the son of the dead king back in power. So Charles II becomes king and rules from 1660 to 1685. He had to give parliament the right to approve taxes. He also had to give up his Royal Courts. The Cavaliers were back in power, and the Anglican church was the church of England. King Charles II was nicknamed the Merry Monarch. He was named this for good reason, he like to party. That kind of lifestyle costs money, and wanting his party to never end, he had to borrow money. People would give him the money, because he would pay back by giving them charters of land in America. In 1625, Dutch took over New Sweden, so it was all New Amsterdam. The Governor Stuyvesant rises. The English had a problem with New Amsterdam. The English decide they're gonna attack in 1664. They claim Stuyvesant was a dictator. (Notes from 10:44). James, the Duke of York, names his new land New York, after himself. He gives the land from the lower Hudson River to the Delaware River to his two friends. They call it New Jersey. In 1666, Charles pays off 8 more men with all the land that will become North and South Carolina.
Quakers led by William Pen. He was born into the British upperclass. His father was an admiral in the Navy, close friend with the King. Young William got expelled from Oxford University. He decided to travel around New England. He begins searching for his own beliefs. He met a group of people, a religious order called The Society of Friends. Their enemies called them Quakers. They believed when they prayed, that God would reveal himself through some kind of inner light. (10:47-48 notes). These Quakers, not only believed the didn't need ministers, they believed they didn't need the bible either.
