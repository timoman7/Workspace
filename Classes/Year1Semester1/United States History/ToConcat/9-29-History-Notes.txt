Once they made landfall, they opened a letter that said who would lead the colony. Intent was to civilize and convert the Indians. They start off by claiming the land they landed on, from the Indians. This pisses off the Indians. About 200 Indian villages in the Tidewater, all under the control of Pohatan. Pohatan controlled about 30 territories, and some 14,000 Algonquian warriors. He traded with the English. He valued them as allies against his enemies. But he never trusted them. He only met with the English at his own capital. Surrounded by a bodyguard of 40 bowmen, his councilers, and some of his 100 wives. Pohatan always looked at the English as sub-human, inferior. When the English build a palicade at Jamestown, Pohatan sent about 400 warriors to attack it, This was on May 26th 1607. 2 English colonists died. When the english opened up with cannons and muskets, the Indians ran away. Pohatan continued to help the English with food that summer. Still 3 Englishmen died from ambushes that summer. On December 12th, members of the Pamunkey tribe killed 2 more settlers, and they captures John Smith. Pohatan took advantage of this. He ritually adopted John Smith, hoping to (something) ties with the (family). 12 colonists were caught trading, begging for food, with some of Pohatans enemies. Pohatan got upset, and killed them. He lined them up and stuffed their mouths with bread, and killed them.
John Smith, out and about with 15 soldiers. He runs into about 200 Indians. Their leader was Opechancanough. Smith challenges (Opechan) to 1-on-1 hand to hand combat. As soon as the fight begins, he grabs (Opechan) by his hair, pushes his musket to his chest, and (Opechan) surrenders. Smith made his point, but (Opechan) won't forget it. The English set up schools and try to get the Indians to send their kids there to learn. The Indians were hesitant, as the English had a tendency to kidnap and kill them. War was becoming inevitable. Pohatan retired in (1617?). Unfortunately, his kin takes over the next (confederacy?), (Opechan). (Opechan) relied on Nematianew. While the Indians are preparing for attack, Nematianew is arrested for murdering a farmer, made obvious as he was wearing the farmers bloody clothes. In May of 1623, they celebrated a treaty with the Indians, and sabotaged them, and gave them a poison sack, telling them it was something else. This killed 200 Indians.
