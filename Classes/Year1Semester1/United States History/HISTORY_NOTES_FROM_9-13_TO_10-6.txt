United States History I notes
Lack of leadership. No king present, current king is in England.
King appoints counsel to his name; didn't work.
September 1608, mercenary John Smith is elected president of the counsel. Takes control of the colony.
Smith was never friendly towards Indians. His treatment of the Powhatans, and their leader, Chief Powhatan, was never understood.
Instead of asking or trading for provisions, Smith would simply take them with threats or simply kill the Indians for them. This was in spite of the Indians saving his life on several occasions. So in 1609, the first of many wars broke out between the Indians and the English. Both sides were brutal. English murdered the Indians, women and children, didn't matter. Even decapitated them, as it bothered the Indians.
For their part, the Powhatans would skin the English alive. Or they would simply scalp them. The Indians learned that from the French, as the act of it wasn't native to the Indians.
John Smith tried to pull the colony together. He was only 26 years old when he arrived at the colony. John Smith was a loud mouth, self-promoter; He bragged about his bravery and resourcefulness,  albeit it true. He forced survivors and newcomers to build, plant, hunt, and fish, to prepare for the next winter. He had a simple rule; If you do not work, you do not eat. He ran the colony as if it was the military, and the company loved it.
The colony had no proper product, for which there was a market. No crop, no product meant no trade, and no profit. No profit means angry investors.
There were very very very few women. This meant there were not a lot of children.
Investors were becoming very upset at the lack of profits. Investors continually asked to supply more money to supply the colonists.
Each of these problems had a solution.
	Site location solution: Move away from the swampy, marshy area. Cases of malaria dropped immediately. They believed the wind carried the illness. They moved to higher ground.
	Solution to the personnel: Solved Ca 1613. The colony needed young healthy men to make it succeed. England had a lot of people that needed land.
		Solution A: Headright system: The company will give 50 acres of land for any person who can pay their way over from England to Virginia. For each additional person that you can pay for to come over as well, you get another 50 acres of land.
		Solution B: Indentured Servitude: Someone between the ages of 13 to 17 who agreed to become the unpaid servant of a master, who in turn would pay for their voyage to Virginia. Once in Virginia, they would remain the property of that master, who in turn would house, feed, and cloth them, for a period of between 5 to 7 years. At the end of that 5 or 7 years, they would receive their freedom, and property between 5 to 10 acres of land. Captains of the voyage ships would find people to come to Virginia, pay for them, and have them sign contracts; Once there, they would sell the contracts to people who needed work. Servants were treated very harshly. Women contracts were destroyed if they agreed to marry their master.
	Solution to problem of leadership: Solved Ca 1609. James I gave the company a new charter. The company could now appoint a governor who would rule in Jamestown. First governor appointed was James Delaware. He never makes it to Virginia, and is shipwrecked in Bermuda. In 1610, Sir Thomas Dale arrives. Dale is an old army man. He enforced the Dale-Laws, meant to shock the colony into discipline.
	Solution to lack of crop: Given by John Rolfe. Companies investors feel like they're making empty investments, some are complaining to the king. Colonists in Virginia find Tobacco weed growing. In England, they've been smoking Tobacco for half a century. That Tobacco comes from Turkey. John Rolfe obtains West Indian Tobacco seed and plants it. West Indian Tobacco flourishes in Virginia. It makes John Rolfe and his neighbors very wealthy. Tobacco becomes known as “brown gold”. Rolfe helped win peace with Indians by marrying Pocahontas. In 1616, Pocahontas dies and is buried in London.
	Solution to problem of no women: Solved by Headright system and Indentured Servitude.
Two big things happen that would change the colonies, and the future of the United States, in 1619. Virginia company establishes the House of Burgesses. Original House of Burgesses was established as a council of advisers, consisting of white male land owners. It would later develop into a lawmaking council, the only one in the British empire. It was technically established in 1618, but didn't meet until 1619. Second occurrence, Dutch merchant ship pulled into Chest bay area. They were low on water. On board they had 20 black African slaves. The Dutch weren't slave traders at the time, most likely captured them from Portuguese slave traders. This opened a new way for plantation owners to look at their labor situation. The new slaves weren't going to get land at the end of their contract. At this period of time, they were never going to be free, so they would never complete their indenture. Slavery from the very beginning was a racist institution.
By 1619 Virginia is firmly established, and it's already developing its own style. But it was still not making money. And it's investors were more and more complaining to the crowd. In 1622 there was a major Indian uprising. The whites in the Chesapeake area numbered over 2000 people. At a certain point, the Indians simply stopped and started to attack. They wipe out more than 300 of the white colonists. The Indians didn't care who they killed. It was over as quick as it began. The whites wiped out the Indians who were involved. As a result, the whites starting killing every Indian they found in the area, along the Chesapeake river. Virginia company investors got the king so upset with their complaining, that he revoked the Virginia company's charter. In 1625, he made Virginia a royal colony, ruled by the king. That's the end of the Virginia company, and the beginning of the end for the Indians in the Chesapeake area.
Discuss the background of the pilgrims and the puritans 

Before the pilgrims came to Plymouth, there were numerous attempts to colonize the new England area. Back in 1602 Bartholomew Gosnold and 32 men sailed on the ship, the concord, from England to present day Maine. They expected to establish a colony there. Instead, they decided to travel further south, along the coast. They went down to present day Martha's Vineyard. Where they stayed for about 5 weeks, trading furs with the Native Americans. They eventually aggravated the natives. And after 1 of the English party gets injured, they decide to return to England. In 1607 the Plymouth company sent an expedition to the Kennebec river in present day Maine. And this colony only lasted about a year. This cost the Plymouth company a lot of money. So the Plymouth company decided to skip the colonization portion of the program. They're gonna go to New England and just trade for furs, and fish. This inevitably led to confrontations with the French. The French were at Port Royal, the Saint Laurence river. The French had their Indian allies among certain tribes. That left other tribes to become allies with the English. The English set up a commercial network among these tribes. And these tribes were enemies to each other, too. They were competing for these European goods. Before the founding of Plymouth, the Indians had fairly extensive experience with the English. This brought catastrophic results for the natives from the English. From 1616 to 1618, a plague was brought over by the English. Large areas of the coast were completely depopulated. Left them open to the English settlements in the 1620s and the 1630s. At first the English were friendly, but they eventually started treating them as lesser beings. They would shoot the Native Americans if they walked into their village on the sabbath. They would kidnap their children, for diplomatic reasons later on. They'd make trade agreement and break them. In 1613, John Smith mapped out the coast of New England. It was the dissenters of the English Church that came from England. The Pilgrims were separatists. One group of these separatists was led by John Robinson. They were led by their meetings in the home of Brewster. They were found out, and realized that if they wanted to live, they had to leave. So they made their way to Leyden, Holland. There, the Dutch had accepted them.
Pilgrims in Leyden Holland. They wanted their children to grow up English, not Dutch. They're able to get two ships, Speedwell and the Mayflower. They left Holland in August of 1620. As soon as they're out of sight of land, the Speedwell starts sinking, and they return back to Holland. They decide to try to make it on the Mayflower. Those who were on the Speedwell didn't want to try to cross the ocean again. They decide to stop in England to pick up more passengers. They pick up 67 more passengers. Not all of them are separatists. In December they leave again, without everyone on-board. On November 9th, the finally reach New England, and they land in what is now Province Town. Captain Mile Standish led a party to explore the inner cape. In December he finds a good harbor and he names it Plymouth. Since not all of them were separatists, they created the Mayflower compact. They landed on the beach, not on Plymouth rock. They began to build housing. They eventually found a Patuxet village. In the first spring, more the half the pilgrims had died. Among the first dead was John Carver. The original destination of the pilgrims was Virginia. They feared shipwreck, so they stayed in Plymouth. However, Plymouth was outside the legal boundaries for the Virginia charter, so they couldn't legally claim any land, but they did. The pilgrims had trouble governing themselves, and they still needed to claim the land, somehow. Luckily they had friendly merchants back in England, who worked out a deal to claim the land for them. They worked out a charter for the land. The merchants had a title for the land, but it had to be payed back. William Bradford was selected to succeed Governor Carve. In spring, an English speaking native came to the village. His name was Squanto, he claimed he was the last surviving Patuxet. He helped the pilgrims. He taught them how to plant maize. He introduced the colonists to Massasoit. His name was Ousamequin, Massasoit was his title. Massasoit meant Great Sachem(chief). They helped harvest the food in the fall of 1621. They held a 3 day feast. The future was looking good for the surviving 51 colonists. Then a ship pulled in, called the Fortune. The Fortune has 35 more colonists. 35 more colonists than the pilgrims originally planned on feeding. There won't be enough food for everyone until the next harvest. The Fortune takes fur and logs, and as soon as its out of sight of land, the French capture it. They make a deal to pay the merchants in 1642, but they don't. However, they do pay them off in 1657. The investors created a joint stock company that they called the . Out of the 120 investors, 20 of them were Puritans. Puritans were members of the Anglican church, they were radical protestants who wanted to purify the Anglican church. One problem the Puritans had with the church of England was the use of bishops. The Puritans went strictly by the bible; There was no mention of bishops in the bible, and as a matter of fact, the bible never establishes the rule of bishops or kings. 
Over in America, the biggest of the churches was called the congregational. They believed all they needed was ministers, not bishops. A minister is just a holy learning man. Harvard college gwas found in 1636; The first graduating class became ministers. Each of these congregational churches goverened itself, supported itself from funds raised from the congregation. They had no altars, no statues, no stained glass representations of saints. The churches were just very plain houses of worship. They didn't celebrate christmas or any other holy days. The ministers didn't wear any of the vestments that the catholic priests did; They wore plain suits. At their meetings they didn't sing any hymns. The puritans follow the teachings of a frenchman named Jean/John Calvin. He taught what was called Predestination. Predestination is the belief that the destiny of each and every person has been predetermined by God. And most of us are going to hell. The elect, the pure ones, will be saved. And the so called visible saints, the true christians, the puritans in other words, are the elect. They were going to heaven and everyone else was going to hell. They were very very intense christians. Puritans not only challenged the authority of the church; They challenged the authority of the king. In 1625, Charles I becomes the king of England. He's the king of england from 1625 to technically 1649. He had a strong dislike for puritans, because they challenged his authority. And subsequently he cracks down on them. But the puritans continue to grow in strength. The king wanted the puritans to conform to his idea of religious practices, the vestments, the sings to hyms, the holy days; All the ideas not dropped off by the Roman catholics. Well the king gets mad; he fires hundreds of ministers, and hundreds of professors from cambridge university. They were all teaching Calvinism. Cambridge England was the heart and soul of the puritan movement. In the late 1620s, within a decade or so, you're gonna have the English war. By the late 1620s, the puritans are mad as hell. They believed that england is moving away from the teachings of the bible. (Mass Bay company 20 puritans). In 1628, the Mass Bay company asks the king for a royal charter in America. They get it in 1629, they called it the charter of 1629(inventive). It does a few things; first: it grants Mass Bay company all the land from 3 miles north of the Merrimac river to 3 miles south of the Charles River. It was from the atlantic to the pacific. Second: The company can govern the colony through meetings. About 4 times the year of the stockholders. They call this the general court. Massachusettes still has the general court. Lastly: That general court anually elects a governer, a luitenant governer, and 8 assistants(judges & magistrates). Very important to remember that the Mass Bay company is a business. Another important thing to remember is that the king messed up. The charter does not say where the charter itself has to be kept. IT also doesn't say where the company meetings must be held. This really opened the door for the puritans. First governer of the Mass Bay company was governer Cradock. He called the meeting of the company to be held in July of 1629, in Cambridge England, the heart and soul of puritanism. Who's gonna show up to this meetings: Just the puritans. A vast majority of the stockholders at the meeting are puritans. In October during the meeting, they elect a new governer, a puritan named John Winthrop. The puritans are the super majority at this meeting now, they have full control. They pass a company rule, an agreement, the cambridge agreement. It states that every owner of stock in the Mass Bay company must move to Massachusettes along with the charter itself. That's huge, they're taking the charter away from the king. And if you're not willing to move to Massachusettes, you have to sell your stock to someone who is. Only ones willing to move there are puritans. The intent of the puritan founders was to establish a self-governing puritan commonwealth. A theocratic state ruled by the godly, the puritans. In other words, a state ruled by the puritans, allowing only puritan ideas, puritan beliefs. In 1630, on the deck of his flightship, the Arbella, John Winthrop gave his now famous sermon: That massachusettes was to be a city on a hill, a beacon for all to see. Before that, they sent a party of workers to send a smooth beginning for the colonies. The king knew nothing about it. The first group head for the colony of salem, or established it, rather. They were lead by Lt. Gov. John Endicot. They established salem, but when Winthrop arrived with over 1000 colonists, he decides to head further south. He pulls into the bay at the foot of Sharmer Hill, where he gives the speech. If you look into the history of Boston, you'll see Saint Botolph. He named his colony after Saint Botolph, Patron saint of Boston. Puritans are completely against the idea of saints. During the war, the puritans are destroying all imagery of saints. Winthrop probably didn't name it after a saint. In 1631, Mass Bay company general court passed a rule called the Rule of 1631. The rule of 1631 states: Only adult male, heads of households, who are members of Massachusettes Congressional churches, may vote or hold office. That meant you had to attend church, pay taxes(tithes) for the minister, you had to be elected to become a member of that church; You're elected by the members of that church.
This meant that the puritans will always rule the colony. There were dissenters of the puritans policies. One was Reverend Roger Williams. First bad thing was he wasn't a puritan at all, he was a separatist. He went to salem for a while and came back to boston. They hated his radical ideas. He was a very outspoken guy, he didn't hold back. He actually pushed for justice for the Indians. He wanted people to buy land from them instead of just taking. He came up with the idea of seperating church from state. He believed no one should be punished for their religious beliefs. This was circa 1636. One of the crazier puritans of the time was Reverend John Cotton. He started attacking Roger Williams. He said his ideas would spell the end of the puritan colony. They bring Williams up on charges; They spell him and his followers from the colony. They leave, and they head southwest, and they found the colony of Rhode Island. (Find out the real name of Rhode Island, hasn't changed since). In Rhode Island they practiced what he preached, his tolerance. As a matter of fact, the very first Jewish Sinigoge in the United States is still there. The other dissenter was the mistress Anne Hutchinson. She was a wealthy and prominent merchant, in a time where women did not have wealthy lives and careers. The puritans didn't like her. She started talking against the ministers of Boston, that they were preaching wrong. The biggest problem they had with Anne Hutchinson was that she was brilliant, that she could talk rings around them. They put her on trial.
Anne Hutchinson
She divided the community. People began to take sides. In 1636, Governor Winthrop decided to put her on trial. The charges were that she was: Subverting the teachings of the ministers. Dividing the community (She said she was going to divide it more). She was acting unwomanly.
They kick her and followers out of Boston. They originally head to Rhode Island. Eventually, her and her family head to Connecticut. The ministers were so angry at her, any time something went wrong with her, they brought it up. In 1643, the Indians killed Anne and 5 of her children. The ministers in Boston preached how she had strayed from the path of God, and this was God paying her back.
Discuss the background of the Pilgrims and the Puritans. What were the intentions of the Puritan Founders of the Mass Bay Colony? Discuss dissenters and why they were dealt with so harshly in both England and Massachusetts?

In 1607, we had the colony in Virginia. It was a company run colony. Next we have a privately run colony, in1620, Plymouth. Another company run colony, Mass Bay Colony, in 1630. Plymouth and Mass Bay are going to end up as royal colonies, under what is called the Dominion of New England. It's also gonna include Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, and New Jersey. (Proprietary colony notes, around 20 minutes in)
Another private mostly Puritan colony was Connecticut. In 1679, New Hampshire was formed as a royal colony.
He wanted Presbyterian Scotland to convert to his Anglican church, by force if necessary. The civil war finally breaks out in 1642, it's between the Cavaliers, the royalist forces, and the Roundheads, the parliamentary forces. Oliver Cromwell, leader of the Roundheads, led them to victory. He captured King Charles I, put him in the Tower of London. In 1649, he executed him. Between 1649 and 1660, England was a Puritan Commonwealth. Oliver Cromwell ruled alone, through the force of his army until his death in 1688(Maybe). His son took over after his death, but he wasn't strong enough to keep it together. They decide to put the monarchy back in power. They put the son of the dead king back in power. So Charles II becomes king and rules from 1660 to 1685. He had to give parliament the right to approve taxes. He also had to give up his Royal Courts. The Cavaliers were back in power, and the Anglican church was the church of England. King Charles II was nicknamed the Merry Monarch. He was named this for good reason, he like to party. That kind of lifestyle costs money, and wanting his party to never end, he had to borrow money. People would give him the money, because he would pay back by giving them charters of land in America. In 1625, Dutch took over New Sweden, so it was all New Amsterdam. The Governor Stuyvesant rises. The English had a problem with New Amsterdam. The English decide they're gonna attack in 1664. They claim Stuyvesant was a dictator. (Notes from 10:44). James, the Duke of York, names his new land New York, after himself. He gives the land from the lower Hudson River to the Delaware River to his two friends. They call it New Jersey. In 1666, Charles pays off 8 more men with all the land that will become North and South Carolina.
Quakers led by William Pen. He was born into the British upperclass. His father was an admiral in the Navy, close friend with the King. Young William got expelled from Oxford University. He decided to travel around New England. He begins searching for his own beliefs. He met a group of people, a religious order called The Society of Friends. Their enemies called them Quakers. They believed when they prayed, that God would reveal himself through some kind of inner light. (10:47-48 notes). These Quakers, not only believed the didn't need ministers, they believed they didn't need the bible either.
Quakers
They were pacifists. They refused to show respect to kings or queens. They believed that was a violation of gods law, to show respect of one person over another. They spoke in old English. They were hated and persecuted not only in England, but in the colonies as well. King Charles II hates young William Penn, because of his beliefs. The king owed Penn's father 16,000 English Pounds. Unfortunately for the king, Penn's father died before he could pay him back. Now he owed the 16,000 Pounds to young William Penn. William Penn would obtain the land that would become Pennsylvania, after his father; It meant Penn's Woods. The reason he wanted that area, was because it was a good location. The area that he would make his future capital, Philadelphia, had a good harbor; It was destined to become the largest city in the colony.  He also wanted it for personal reasons. He wanted it to get it. Secondly, he wanted to do good, to help mankind. Penn was what they call a philanthropist. He personally wanted to prove the idea that the Quakers weren't crazy. That the Quaker ideas were the essence of humanity, brotherly love. Lastly, he wanted to show that people in his colony of diverse background could exist and live together in harmony. Finally, on March 4th of 1601, Penn gets the charter for Pennsylvania, wipes out the kings debt. He names his capital Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. With all his good intentions, the problem was, William Penn was a horrible business man. He advertised for people to come to Pennsylvania, in the colonies and in England. He got a mixed response. Who were the people that came to Pennsylvania? New England Puritans, they hated the Quakers, but they loved the rich soil. The Dutch and the Swedes also came to Pennsylvania. It looked like a golden country to them, freedom from persecution. English Quakers also came. The Pennsylvania Deutsch also came, they eventually became known as the Amish. Another group that came was the Scots-Irish. They weren't Irish. When England conquered Ireland, they sent the Scots from Ireland. The Scots-Irish loved to fight. Overall, Penn's holy experiment really worked, all these different kinds of people lived together in peace. Except for one notable exception: William Penn allowed slavery. Which is odd, considering how all of Penn's writings showed how against slavery he was.
Describe the early relations between the English colonists and the Native Americans, 1584-1676. Discuss, in detail, the three major wars and the sources of each conflict?
The contact between the Europeans and the Native Americans occurred long before the creation of the American colony.
They built this policy with the belief that Native Americans were subhumans. Not equal to the Spaniards. The Spanish saw the natives as savages. They saw that they needed either, Christianity, or death. The French in North and Central America were very different in their treating of the Native Americans. For the most part, the French formed alliances whenever possible with the different federations they encountered. By treating the Indians as equal partners, it usually resulted in mutual benefits, usually huge profits for the French. It also gave the french many strong allies during confrontations with the English. If you make an ally, you also make enemies; Your allies enemies become yours. This left some tribes to become allied with the English (Incas?).

Interaction between Native Americans and the English colonists.
The English tended to treat the Indians with the same disdain as the Spanish. John Smith was not an accommodating fellow when it came to Indians. He kidnapped and killed them when he wanted to. Before the Jamestown colony was the colony at Roanoke. One of the leaders of this first group was named Arthur Barlowe. He was either high, or he was a liar. Roanoke lacked good soil, didn't have a deep harbor. William Raleigh sends Richard Grenville and Ralph Lane to lead an expedition, they were military men, veterans of the Irish campaign. They led the next colony. They were gonna run the colony like a military camp. Grenville had a habit of when he got mad, he would break a glass cup and eat the glass. Ralph Lane tried to gain the cooperation of the Indians, or rather the Indian leader. Oddly, trying to do this; He kidnapped the leader's favorite son. Next year in April 1586, a shipment of supplies doesn't show up. Lane looks at the Indians like they're gonna attack. So he decides to launch a preemptive counterattack. He cuts off the head of Wingina and puts it on a post around the fort. Now it is in summer. Their food is almost gone. Any relations they had with the Indians is definitely gone. And no supply ships are scheduled to come. They can't plant, hunt, or fish, because the Indians are waiting outside their fort waiting for them to come out. They were very lucky, all of a sudden they see a sail. None other than Francis Drake, a future pirate, shows up. He's loaded with supplies. Grenville and Lane order the people to unload all the supplies. He doesn't want the supplies, he want's them off the boat so they can sail back to England. So Walter Raleigh tries again. He picks a man named John White to lead this expedition. There's over a hundred settlers this time. He tells John White to go further North. Apparently, John White and the pilot argue who is in charge. They show up at Roanoke, and the pilot dumps them there and leaves.
Once they made landfall, they opened a letter that said who would lead the colony. Intent was to civilize and convert the Indians. They start off by claiming the land they landed on, from the Indians. This pisses off the Indians. About 200 Indian villages in the Tidewater, all under the control of Pohatan. Pohatan controlled about 30 territories, and some 14,000 Algonquian warriors. He traded with the English. He valued them as allies against his enemies. But he never trusted them. He only met with the English at his own capital. Surrounded by a bodyguard of 40 bowmen, his councilers, and some of his 100 wives. Pohatan always looked at the English as sub-human, inferior. When the English build a palicade at Jamestown, Pohatan sent about 400 warriors to attack it, This was on May 26th 1607. 2 English colonists died. When the english opened up with cannons and muskets, the Indians ran away. Pohatan continued to help the English with food that summer. Still 3 Englishmen died from ambushes that summer. On December 12th, members of the Pamunkey tribe killed 2 more settlers, and they captures John Smith. Pohatan took advantage of this. He ritually adopted John Smith, hoping to (something) ties with the (family). 12 colonists were caught trading, begging for food, with some of Pohatans enemies. Pohatan got upset, and killed them. He lined them up and stuffed their mouths with bread, and killed them.
John Smith, out and about with 15 soldiers. He runs into about 200 Indians. Their leader was Opechancanough. Smith challenges (Opechan) to 1-on-1 hand to hand combat. As soon as the fight begins, he grabs (Opechan) by his hair, pushes his musket to his chest, and (Opechan) surrenders. Smith made his point, but (Opechan) won't forget it. The English set up schools and try to get the Indians to send their kids there to learn. The Indians were hesitant, as the English had a tendency to kidnap and kill them. War was becoming inevitable. Pohatan retired in (1617?). Unfortunately, his kin takes over the next (confederacy?), (Opechan). (Opechan) relied on Nematianew. While the Indians are preparing for attack, Nematianew is arrested for murdering a farmer, made obvious as he was wearing the farmers bloody clothes. In May of 1623, they celebrated a treaty with the Indians, and sabotaged them, and gave them a poison sack, telling them it was something else. This killed 200 Indians.
(Narra) =  Narragansetts
(Wess) =  Wessagusetts
(Poka) =  Pokanokets
Squanto helped negotiate an alliance between the settlers and the Pokanokets. Against their traditional enemies, the Narragansetts. The (Poka) thought by doing this they were protecting their homeland. The English rewarded Squanto by giving him some land. Before Squanto died in 1622, he tried to get the (Poka) to attack the English. In 1622, some (number) settlers, the Wessagusett, stole some corn from the Massachusetts tribe. The (Wess) threatened them with attack if they don't trade. Mile (Name at 9 minutes) led an assault at (also 9 minutes in) including their leader, Witumamet, and he put his head on a pike. In 1633-34, Smallpox ravaged the Indians. The pilgrims and the puritans looked at this as gods intervention, just when they needed more land. They were nasty in the ways they got land from the Indians. Some of them took questionable claims to the courts. Some would send their livestock to their property, and say something like “The livestock know where they want to live”. All of this led to what became known as the Pequot war. The settlers claimed it was because of the murder of 2 sea captains: One was captain John Stone; Captain Stone was already an outlaw by the time he was killed in 1634. The other was Captain John Oldham; He was found dead off the coast of (block? 14 min) island. They weren't really the reason for the war, the real reasons for the war were: 1st Hostility towards the native Americans. 2nd  Trade rivalry with the Dutch. And lastly, 3rd was inter-tribal disputes. The dutch controlled trade in new England in the 1630s, through the tribes in New England. The dutch bought land from the Pequots in present day. They built an outpost to supposedly ward off the English. Some Indian tribes were already signing over with the New Englanders. The Mohegans wanted to get out from under the thumb of the (Pequots? 17 min). They did so with the help of Aron Manson. The Mohegans asked the dutch for some help. The Pequots were a pretty nasty group, very aggressive people. The name Pequot means destroyer. (Notes at 19 min). The dutch in turn killed the Pequots and banned from the post. The Narragansetts mobilized for war. The Pequots turn to the Narragansetts colony for help. They invite the (20 min) for help, start trading with them. The Puritans establish the settlement, and a truce is arranged between them and the Pequots. The Pequots looked at this as a truce among equals, but not the Puritans. After a couple of years, the Puritans demand that the Pequots deliver the murderers of Captain John Stone. The Pequots refuse, but they kept the peace. A few days after this, the body of Captain Oldham washed up on (block? 23 min) Island. Once again, the Puritans blamed the Pequots, but in reality it was the Narragansetts. So the Puritans launched an attack of (block? 23 min) Island, and the main land(23-24 min notes). Both of these attacks were disasters. The Pequots pushed the Puritans into the old Fort Saybrook (25 min notes). At this point, Roger Williams arranged with the Narragansetts to sign a peace treaty with the English. The English Puritans in Connecticut gathered around 100(70?) men and broke the siege at Fort Saybrook. That was in April of 1637. Now with the help of some more (Narra), they attacked a Pequot village, right along the (26 min) river, there was a massacre. First it was mostly women and children. They surrounded the village and set it on fire, they wouldn't let anybody out. Colonists from Massachusetts and Connecticut, (27 min notes) began to hunt the Pequots down, sold everybody who wasn't slain into slavery. That pretty much ended the Pequot tribe. Trouble with the natives ended for nearly 3 decades, and ended the Pequot war. But their need to Christianize the Indians, (28 min notes), and the ever expanding need for land, led to the next war. This began the (28-29 min) war. The son of the Massasoit, Metacomet, was born after the Pequot war. He lived in Massachusetts. When Massasoit, died in 1660, his elder son, Wamsutta, became chief. They were given names by the Plymouth colony. Wamsutta was given the name Alexander. Metacomet was given the name Phillip. As leader of the Wampanoags, Alexander did his best to protect the land. Their all suing each other to get pieces of land away from each other. Finally in 1664, a commissioner sent over by the king, they decide that no colony (32 notes). On top of that, the commission designated Metacomet a free (something at 32), meaning he only has to answer to the king, not any colony. Now, Alexander had already been selling land before the commission. In 1664, an armed party of colonists from Plymouth take him captive. They're gonna force him to testify in court, and force him to sell them some land. Great plan except Alexander dies in jail. Phillip expects poison. He remains very wary of the English after he becomes chief. Philip continues selling to both colonies, as a conscious and aggressive act of independence. He's making it clear that he, not the colonies, legally own the land. The Plymouth colony establish a site across the village, called Swansea. One of king Phillips councilors, went to Plymouth and told them Phillip was getting ready to attack. (36-37 min notes). The English arrested 3 Wampanoags, but they weren't the ones who did it. (38 min notes). On June 20th, 1675, Phillips Indians cross the water into Swansea and attack the cattle, a 10 year old with a musket protects the cattle and shoots and kills one of the Indians, that's the start of the war. (39 min notes). They raid (towns at 40 min). By this time over 100 whites are killed. February 20th 1676, they attacked Lancaster again, capturing Mary Rowlenson. They ambush 65 Plymouth soldiers and their allies. (numbers at 41 min). A few days later, March 29th 1676, they burned the city of Providence Rhode Island to the ground. It got to the point, 10 miles of the attack, in the city of Boston, where the city leaders considered building a wall around the city to protect it, so they put it to a vote. It didn't pass because it was 1 vote shy. On July 22nd 1676, (name at 44 min) captured King Phillips child. King Phillip was enraged, and was so mad that he jumped up and killed the warrior next to him. The warriors brother, went and told Church were to find him. Church found Phillip and killed him. The last band of villagers was captured on August 28th of 1676 and sold into slavery.
A full time customs service is established in America. They establish taxes, yada yada yada. Admiralty courts are established in America. They're to hear cases rising  out of the navigation acts.
Most Americans aren't effected by these laws. The ones effected live in the sea.
In 1763, everything changes.
